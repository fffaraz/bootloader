INT 0x10 is a BIOS video interrupt. All the video related calls are made through this interrupt.
To use this interrupt we need to set the values of some register.
AL = ASCII value of character to display
AH = 0x0E ;Teletype mode (This will tell bios that we want to print one character on screen)
BL = Text Attribute (This will be the fore ground and background color
  	 of character to be displayed. 0x07 in our case.)
BH = Page Number (0x00 for most of the cases)

Once all the registers all filled with appropriate value, we can call interrupt.
